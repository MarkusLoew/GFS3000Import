# GFS3000Import
R package to import files generated by the WALZ GFS3000 photosynthesis system

GFS3000 imports zero points and measurement points as separate data frames and the units of the measured parameters as a vector. The "import" argument can be set to either "all", for everything, or "MP", for measurement points only. Default is "all".

It returns list containing three data frames: 
* "ZP" for Zeropoints, i.e. the calibration data, 
* "MP" for the measurement points, i.e. the hopefully meaningful data, and 
* "Units" with a vector of the units to accompany the data. 

Or, if the "import" argument is set to "MP", just a dataframe with the measurement points MP. Depends on the value for "import".

## Examples:

* ImportGFS("light_response/2019-01-16_Pyc_1.csv", import = "none")

* ImportGFS("light_response/2019-01-16_Pyc_1.csv", import = "all")

* ImportGFS("light_response/2019-01-16_Pyc_1.csv", import = "MP")
